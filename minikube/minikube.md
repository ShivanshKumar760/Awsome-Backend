# 🧪 Running the Sandbox API with Minikube

This guide explains:

- ✅ Will this API work with Minikube?
- 🏗 How to set up Minikube
- 🐳 How to build images correctly
- 🔐 Required permissions (RBAC)
- 🧪 How to test everything locally

# ✅ Will This API Work with Minikube?

Yes — **100% it will work**.

Minikube runs a real Kubernetes cluster locally. Your API talks to the Kubernetes API server using:

```
@kubernetes/client-node
```

As long as:

- Minikube is running
- Your kubeconfig is configured
- The sandbox image exists inside Minikube

Your API can dynamically create Pods.

# 🧠 Architecture When Using Minikube

```
Your Laptop
    ↓
Minikube Kubernetes Cluster
    ↓
Sandbox Pods Created Dynamically
```

If API runs locally:

```
Local Node App
      ↓
Minikube API Server
      ↓
Sandbox Pod
```

If API runs inside Minikube:

```
API Pod
   ↓
Kubernetes API
   ↓
Sandbox Pod
```

Both approaches work.

# 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup

---

# 1️⃣ Install Minikube

Install from official website:

https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/

---

# 2️⃣ Start Minikube

```bash
minikube start
```

Verify:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see one node running.

---

# 3️⃣ Make Docker Use Minikube's Docker Engine

Very important step.

```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

Now when you run `docker build`, it builds inside Minikube.

---

# 4️⃣ Build Sandbox Image

```bash
docker build -t custom-node-sandbox:latest .
```

If you skip this, your pods will fail with:

```
ImagePullBackOff
```

---

# 5️⃣ Run Your API

If running locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your code will use:

```ts
kc.loadFromDefault();
```

Which loads:

```
~/.kube/config
```

That config automatically points to Minikube.

---

# 🧪 Testing Pod Creation

Call your endpoint:

```
POST /api/v1/sandbox/init
```

Then check:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

You should see:

```
sandbox-1-abc123
```

---

# 🔐 If Running API Inside Minikube

You must create RBAC role.

Example Role:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: sandbox-role
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods", "pods/exec"]
    verbs: ["create", "delete", "get", "list"]
```

And bind it to your ServiceAccount.

---

# ⏳ Important: Wait for Pod Readiness

Pods take time to start.

Before executing code, you should:

- Check Pod phase
- Wait until status = Running

Otherwise exec may fail.

---

# 🚨 Common Errors and Fixes

## ❌ ImagePullBackOff

Build image inside Minikube using docker-env.

## ❌ Forbidden Error

Missing RBAC permissions.

## ❌ Exec Fails

Pod not ready yet.

## ❌ Pod Pending

Not enough memory allocated to Minikube.

Fix by increasing memory:

```bash
minikube start --memory=4096
```

---

# 🏗 Resource Requirements

Each sandbox pod uses:

- 512Mi memory
- 500m CPU

If MAX_CONTAINERS = 3

Minimum recommended Minikube memory:

2GB - 4GB

---

# 🎯 Final Answer

Yes, your Kubernetes-based API works perfectly with Minikube.

Minikube is ideal for:

- Local development
- Testing dynamic pod creation
- Debugging sandbox execution
- Learning Kubernetes

It behaves like a real cluster, just single-node.

# 🚀 Production vs Minikube

| Feature        | Minikube    | Production Cluster |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Nodes          | 1           | Many               |
| Scaling        | Manual      | Auto-scaling       |
| Load balancing | Basic       | Advanced           |
| Suitable for   | Development | Production         |

---

# 🧠 Final Architecture Summary

Your API does NOT create Docker containers directly anymore.

It:

- Talks to Kubernetes API
- Kubernetes schedules Pods
- Pods run your sandbox image
- You exec into Pods
- You delete Pods after use

That works locally in Minikube and in real cloud clusters.

You are now building cloud-native infrastructure 🚀
